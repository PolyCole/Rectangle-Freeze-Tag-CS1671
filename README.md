# Rectangle-Freeze-Tag-CS1671
The second version of a rectangle freeze tag game. 

A simple game of freeze tag with moving rectangles created using StdDraw.

Rectangles are initialized with a random number of hit points between 1 and three.
Additionally, rectangles spawn with a random color. When a rectangle hits the edge of
the canvas, the color is randomly changed.

If the user clicks their mouse within the rectangle border, the hit count is decreased.
If the rectangle has no hit points left, it freezes until the game ends or another 
rectangle collides with it. 

Rectangle Freeze Tag v1 was developed in Collaboration with:
